#RedChain

RedChain is a simple daily goal tracker. The Pro version allows multiple chains, and chain customization.

This project is largely written in Kotlin. The few Java classes scattered about were pulled over from other projects,
but they do conveniently serve to demonstrate Java <--> Kotlin interoperability.
